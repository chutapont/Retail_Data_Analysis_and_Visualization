##Insights and Recommendations
- While all product brands are generating stable sales across each month of the year, Electronic brands: BlueStar, Misubhisi, and Whirepool can generate sales in particular months only. Further investigation is needed to uncover the underlying reasons of such result and consider adding promotions to recover sales.
- Product sales have fallen during the last quarter and remained flat throughout September to December - Investigate further on what could be the reasons and what actions are needed to bring up sales for the next fiscal year.
